# What is information disclosure?
     Information disclosure, also known as information leakage, is when a website unintentionally reveals sensitive information to its users. Depending on      the context, websites may leak all kinds of information to a potential attacker, including:
     
        Data about other users, such as usernames or financial information
        Sensitive commercial or business data
        Technical details about the website and its infrastructure
